This folder contains the projects created by using the raylib library.
Started this workflow to learn about the graphics libraries available for C and C++.
Followed the tutorials from the Youtube channel : https://www.youtube.com/@programmingwithnick to learn the basics of the library.

The capstone project after learning the various graphic libraries is to build a very simple working game engine.
